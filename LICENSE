IMPORTANT :

A large portion of the backend of this code is based on Makingthings's Make 
Controller OSC C# implementation. I cannot find the license, authors or 
original code repository. The original Makingthings website is down. 
Hence the licensing of those parts of code are unknow. 

FOR THE PARTS THAT I CODED OR MODIFIED :
